# About 

My name is Brendan, I am a creative developer based out of California. 

I write interactive websites, create 3D visuals for musicians, and code CLI applications.

I have a background in music composition from both San Diego State University and New York University.

I really enjoyed the technical aspect of music production, and found myself researching endlessly into different software to make the sounds I wanted.

Programming is the perfect balance between freeform creativity and structured processes.

It ticks all the boxes for me.

Outside of coding, I am an avid surfer and a fan of trying Linux distros (currently Manjaro).

## Tech
I use TypeScript and Go daily, as both are great for speed and type safety.

My current personal stack: **Svelte** + **ThreeJS**

I use Python for scripting in SideFX Houdini.

**I am comfortable with**: 
- React 
- NodeJS 
- Express
- Chakra-UI
- Styled Components

- GORM

**I want to learn more about**: 
- net/http package 
- Websockets
- Rust

- Qt
