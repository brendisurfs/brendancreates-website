# About

My name is **Brendan**, I am a creative developer based out of California.

I write **reactive websites**, create **3D visuals for musicians**, and code **CLI applications**.

My background is in music composition from **San Diego State University** and **New York University**.

Outside of coding, I am an avid surfer and a fan of messing with Linux distros.
