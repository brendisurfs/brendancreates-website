# About

My name is **Brendan**, I am a creative developer based out of California.

I write **reactive websites**, create **3D visuals for musicians**, and code **CLI applications**.

My background is in music composition from **San Diego State University** and **New York University**.

Outside of coding, I am an avid surfer and a fan of messing with Linux distros.

A lot of my life revolves around artistic and creative activities, while somehow weaving as much technology as I can into it.

With music composition, I got into the aspect of modular and generative soundscapes. This put me down the path of eurorack and modular synthesis, which helped build the foundation for understanding functions and loops. Eurorack and modular synthesizers were fun, but also prohibitively expensive and not very sustainable as a young composer.

I dove into 3D work in the later part of 2019, and it started to snowball from there. After some searching and testing, I found Houdini. Houdini was the catalyst that put me down the path of programming.

I started to learn Python to further my abilities to customize workflows in Houdini, and got extremely lucky to have had one of the best teachers to show me the art of coding.

After getting the basics down and realizing that I wanted to code more, I got into Javascript and web development. Web development is a seemingly infinite landscape, there is always something new to learn.
I have always been curious about how everything works, so this seemed like the right path to go down.
