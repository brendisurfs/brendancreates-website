# brendancreates-website

This is a public repo for my in-progress website. 
I decided to go with Svelte on this one because it seemed like an interesting way to get back into the swing of front-end vanilla Typescript 
after using React/Typescript for pretty much every web app I have built.
It has also strengthened my CSS skills faster than I ever thought.
