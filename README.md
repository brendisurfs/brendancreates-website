### current version: **_0.6.0_**

This is a public repo for my in-progress website.
I decided to go with Svelte on this one because it seemed like an interesting way to get back into the swing of front-end vanilla Typescript
after using React/Typescript for pretty much every web app I have built.
It has also strengthened my CSS skills faster than I ever thought.
